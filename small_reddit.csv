First off, I will gladly concede that the vaccine does not seem to be offering people long-term protection against getting COVID infection.  This report clearly shows that, and we've seen data from Ireland and Israel that confirms as well.  I know your instinct will be to dismiss this statement I'm about to make, but I encourage you to really think about it:

Even if a vaccine does not offer meaningful protection against contracting a disease does not mean it does not significantly reduce the spread of this disease.  Catching a disease and spreading it are two different things.

The spread and impact of a disease is a function of severity and duration of symptoms, which this report lays out very clearly:

# Transmission

A person is contagious when their viral load gets high - which is usually accompanied by symptoms.  Since unvaccinated people are clearly having more severe symptoms, and for longer, it's reasonable to assume that, on average, they are contributing *more* to the spread of the disease, which means that the vaccine is clearly reducing transmission.

The vaccine is not perfect, but like the initial polio vaccine - it's good enough for now.",0

Kid goes to college.  Meets new people, is exposed to new ideas.  Figures out that the people they grew up with are pretty much wrong about everything they think and feel.

Go home and try to expose those people to the world they learned about.  The people get angry.

I know this because this was my town.  This is what happened to people that left the town for one reason or another.

My town is 99.8% white and Christian according to the last census.  It has a population of 1,711 and has 6 churches. This is smack dab in Pennsyltucky, not the Bible Belt.

These people are racist despite them never being exposed to different races and xenophobic about religion despite them never being exposed to different religions.

I left there in 1995 and never went back.  Over the years, I have severed ties with every single person there, even family, because they just got further and further right.  especially after Obama was elected.

I didn't ""turn"" liberal.  I was always liberal.  It's just that being liberal while living there wasn't exactly safe.

The total impact with near-universal masking -- perhaps achievable with alternative strategies or stricter enforcement -- may be several times larger [than what the study observed]""

What the study was designed to determine was whether wearing masks had an impact at all in reducing symptomatic seroprevalence -- that is, whether less people were exhibiting symptoms of covid; and where possible actually checking whether they _had_ covid.  They determined that yes, masks were effective; and surgical masks were more effective than cloth masks.  Which is different from ""cloth mask mandates are useless"".

They went further and added ""Because the study was powered to detect differences in symptomatic seroprevalence, we cannot
distinguish whether masks work by making symptoms less severe (through a reduced viral load at transmission) or by reducing new infections.""

It makes me seriously question how these people became CPA's or what's being taught in CPA school, because when I'm finding tens of thousands in deductions that they're blowing over, it really makes me question why they exist at all.  Based on my experience? The profession exists so if there is a mistake, it's the CPA's fault and not mine.  I'd rather just pay $200/year for tax return insurance to an insurance company and then just shoot from the hip and do my taxes in 20 mins/year since the accountants are missing so much.",1
hi1vfb1,anormaldayinrussia,1635206227,"I am. Thank you :)

Long long story, but my city was exposed. My parents knew before hand, so I drank a lot of iodine (mixed with water of course). Many people died, children too. Too many funerals.

I am at a high risk for thyroid cancer, but before that, possible hormonal issues. It has been 30 years, and I was always told I have to be vigilant when I get older.

I am lucky to live in Canada. Since I was a teenager really.

My health care is free, and my doctor is Russian.  I really do not have to elaborate, she does the necessary tests.  Lately though I have been having issues, and since it's still COVID I haven't seen her in person.

Still, I have a phone appointment, and I guess we will take it from there.",1

Are you just a little scared? (that's ok). Or is you opinion based on something besides fear? (if so, better get publishing your research before its too late! lol) 

Heres a link to a paper from 2008, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730064/

hi1vds8,navy,1635206207,"To elaborate a bit (cause you're entirely right about the equipment), the German military pioneered advances in radio communication and distributed command long before other European powers.  In the wake of the Franco-Prussian war, the Prussian military knew the future was going the direction of rapid mobilisation, and they took great strides in developing modern logistics which helped them dominate the first months of WW1.  Those lessons weren't forgotten after the war.  It's not that German commanders attacked fast, it's that they knew how to move the entire force rapidly and efficiently.  Once any part of that superb network broke down though...

To bring it back to the topic at hand, the American military hasn't been focused on a hot war in decades and I'm skeptical that our logistics chains could take the stress of a such a conflict.  I mean just look how much the private shipping sector is still struggling to recover from Covid.  Now I'm not sure China is much better off in this regard, and they certainly don't have the institutional knowledge that we do.

Might look into the app maybe. I dunno. I have been on meds for years and we were trying to change them this summer to see if we could get something more effective, but the process went so badly and when I ended up in the ER one day the place seemed to be slammed due to covid, so I decided not to mess with meds anymore until the pandemic lets up (hopefully it will sometime soon somehow). 

Meanwhile finding treatment has been even worse. I've done exposure therapy twice for the religious OCD and it failed both times. I almost wonder if the religious *trauma* part of it complicates the use of ERP for it. Maybe it's just too severe to be treated that way. I don't know.

I've yet to meet anyone who understands both OCD **and** Religious Trauma, and if they're out there I imagine they won't accept my insurance.

To be totally honest, I think I've lost hope. I really don't know what to do next.

Even beyond christianity, my disorder insists that when I die I'll meet the creator of all things, who I've pissed off, and said creator will do everything in its power to make my eternal afterlife even worse than hell. ""Why would you hate or oppose that which maintains reality itself, are you insane?"" That's the general thought.

But I mean, what if there really is *nothing out there*? What a fucking waste to live so scared. I wasted many years in the past as a result of that, I'm still wasting time and energy even now worried about such things.

One tiny example, I still feel genuine fear about downloading music illegally. 

Sure it's a mixed thing in terms of morality, it's up for debate, but I really wish the fear of supernatural and possibly eternal punishment wasn't a fucking factor.

If I decide that AC/DC isn't going to miss the amount of money I'm losing them by illegally downloading a song from them, then that should be that. Because there's no god or anything similar to be afraid of, and if I get hit by a bus tomorrow I'll just stop existing.

Unfortunately I don't know that for a fact. Therein lies the suffering.",1

México ha aplicado 115 millones 185 mil 985 dosis de vacunas contra el COVID-19, de acuerdo con cifras de la Secretaría de Salud actualizadas hasta el 24 de octubre.

[Así va la vacunación COVID por entidad. (Secretaría de Salud). ](https://i.imgur.com/UL2TRFC.jpg)

Según la dependencia, 69 millones 974 mil 180 personas mayores de 18 años en el país ha recibido al menos una dosis de dichas vacunas, lo que equivale al 78 por ciento de la población.

Específicamente, 53 millones 487 mil 503 mexicanos cuentan con un esquema de vacunación completo (76 por ciento del total del personas inoculadas). En tanto que a 16 millones 486 mil 677 personas se les ha aplicado un esquema nuevo (24 por ciento del total del personas inoculadas).

**La Secretaría de Salud toma como población de 18 años o más un total de 89 millones 484 mil 507 personas, basada en una proyección de población a mitad de año 2021 del Consejo Nacional de Población (Conapo)**. Por lo que 19 millones 510 mil 327 adultos faltan de recibir al menos una dosis de vacunas COVID.

El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ha expresado en reiteradas ocasiones el compromiso de su gobierno para que en octubre de este año todos los adultos mexicanos cuenten por lo menos con una dosis de vacunas contra el COVID-19.

En cuanto a entidades, la Ciudad de México es la que cuenta con la mayor cobertura de vacunación en el país, al tener inoculada con al menos una dosis al 97 por ciento de su población mayor de edad.

Quintana Roo, con 95 por ciento, y Querétaro, con 92 por ciento, son las entidades que siguen en cuanto a cobertura de vacunación COVID.

Los estados que cuentan con al menor 80 por ciento de su población inoculada con una dosis son: Aguascalientes (80 por ciento), Baja California (82 por ciento), Baja California Sur (82 por ciento), Chihuahua (82 por ciento), Durango (80 por ciento), San Luis Potosí (89 por ciento), Sinaloa (87 por ciento), Tamaulipas (83 por ciento), Tlaxcala (82 por ciento), Yucatán (86 por ciento) y Zacatecas (83 por ciento).

Por otra parte, la entidad con una menor cobertura de vacunación es Chiapas, con 52 por ciento. Le siguen Guerrero, con 63 por ciento; Oaxaca, con 65 por ciento; Puebla, con 67 por ciento; Veracruz, con 68 por ciento, y Michoacán, con 69 por ciento. Todas, por abajo del 70 por ciento de población vacunada con al menos una dosis.

El caso de Chiapas se ha atribuido a la desconfianza de la población indígena hacia la vacunación y a que muchas comunidades se encuentran alejadas de centros urbanos donde hay una mayor inmunización.

^(October 26, 2021)





James Kon




As the number of attendances at vaccination centres throughout the country has declined, the Ministry of Health has opened up the administration of first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine via walk-in starting today. The announcement was made by Minister of Health Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohd Isham bin Haji Jaafar atthe daily press conference.




The first dose of COVID-19 vaccine via walk-in is available in all vaccination centres, said the minister.




Individuals wanting to get vaccinated can bring their identity card or passport, and Bru-Hims card, if available. The minister also advised the public to bring a pen and an umbrella as well as enough water. The minister reminded the public to wear a face mask and observe physical distancing at all times.

I was home from work on a doctor’s note for four days and on the 5th day I went back to work. Being in medicine, we have to answer a series of health questions daily to screen for symptoms. I couldn’t answer yes, as needed, so I spoke with the infection prevention nurse who put me on quarantine based on my symptoms. I then went to a drugstore and got the PCR, which is a more in-depth Covid test. I got notification the next day I was positive for Covid. I have been on quarantine for 10 days and my first day back to work is tomorrow. I have a desk job so I will be able to manage my ongoing shortness of breath which may not resolve for a few months.

hi1v56m,carsaustralia,1635206094,"Are you happy with the amount that you received? That's really all that matters. I sold my 2011 Ford Falcon FG Ute with 170,000kms for $8500. The bloke who bought it re-listed it on CarSales for $14,500. He readjusted the price over the course of 4 months during lockdown and eventually sold it for $12,000. 

Personally I was originally wanting $10,000 for it but I didn't want to deal with three things: 1) Organising test drives with random people during covid. 2) Having a second vehicle taking up driveway space. 3) Paying for mechanical fixes to comply with RWC (approx. $2500 worth of repairs). 

I already bought my new car and for 8\~ months the second ute was just sitting there. On CarSales the same year/model ute is now listed for as little as $9,000 and as much as $16,000.

I'll be honest and say that I was a tad disappointed with myself when I saw the relisting price of $14,500. I kept repeating in my head I could have negotiated harder for an extra k or two but in hind sight the deal was what I wanted: no hassle, no haggle. The bloke turned up to my place on an agreed date to test drive it (he's an authorised second hand dealer so I wasn't concerned about him stealing it), test drove it for 5 minutes and immediately transferred the money into my account. 

If I had gone the private selling route, who knows, the car would more than likely still be collecting dust on the driveway....",1
